# Project Brief: [Project Name]

## 1. Project Overview

### Problem Statement
For accounting purposes I need my individual invoice fetcher which downloads the needed invoices documents as pdf documents from a varaity of web pages and stores it in a database. 
The list of these pages has to be maintainable. The application als shows also the already stored incoides for each web page.
Later I can selected the incovoces that thad had been charaged for a specific month and download it one zip file on my file system. I provide this zip file for my accountant and other occounting tools.


### Solution Overview
Because each target pages has its own invdividual authentication flow it needs to be done manually in separate browser window. Aufter the Authentication process the application looks for 
all exisiting invoices and syncs it with the local database. The invoices that are not in the database has to be downloaded automatically. The identifier is the file name and invoice name provided on the web site.
Both the authenctication process and the invoice finder of the targed page needs to be implemented invidually. For example by screenscrapeing or by using a api. It depends on the targed page.

## 2. Requirements

### Functional Requirements


#### Core Features
1. **Feature 1:** 
   - Description: Shows the list of pages whose invoice needs to be downloaded. Each entry shows a sublist of already downloaded invoices with filename and invoice date. There is also a "Download Invoices" button for each targed page.
    

2. **Feature 2:** 
   - Description: The Download buttons opens a new browser window and starts the authentication process of the targed page. After a successfull authentication it closes the browser windows. It sarches for new Invoices and stores the into the local data base
   - User Story: I want to download invoices automatically so that save a lot of time.

3. **Feature 3:** 
   - Description: Ther is is progress bar which shows how much are fetched and how many needs to be fetched in the process. It also shows if it was successful or not.

#### Additional Features

### Non-Functional Requirements
No login for the application required.
